\section{Sheaves}
\label{section-sheaves}

Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $x \in X$ be a point.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf of sets on $X$.
The {\it stalk of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$} is the set
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\colim_{x\in U} \mathcal{F}(U)
$$
where the colimit is over the set of open neighbourhoods
$U$ of $x$ in $X$. The set of open neighbourhoods is
partially ordered by (reverse) inclusion:
We say $U \geq U' \Leftrightarrow U \subset U'$.
The transition maps in the system are
given by the restriction maps of $\mathcal{F}$.
See Categories, Section \ref{categories-section-posets-limits}
for notation and terminology regarding (co)limits over systems.
Note that the colimit is a directed colimit.
Thus it is easy to describe $\mathcal{F}_x$. Namely,
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\{
(U, s)
\mid
x\in U, s\in \mathcal{F}(U)
\}/\sim
$$
with equivalence relation given by $(U, s) \sim (U', s')$ if and only if
there exists an open $U'' \subset U \cap U'$ with $x \in U''$ and
$s|_{U''} = s'|_{U''}$. Given a pair $(U, s)$ we sometimes denote
$s_x$ the element of $\mathcal{F}_x$ corresponding to the equivalence
class of $(U, x)$. We sometimes use the phrase
``image of $s$ in $\mathcal{F}_x$'' to denote $s_x$.
For example, given two pairs $(U, s)$ and $(U', s')$ we sometimes
say ``$s$ is equal to $s'$ in $\mathcal{F}_x$'' to indicate
that $s_x = s'_x$. Other authors use the terminology
``germ of $s$ at $x$''.

\bigskip\noindent

Here's my unexpected encounter with the definition of tensor product of sheaves.
It's not the ``fiber is tensor product of fibers'' construction, but actually
just some notion of ``change of ring'' sheaf that ends up being adjoint to
some ``restriction'' sheaf. The setting is a mapping of presheaves {\it of
rings} over a space $X$… (I think the usual definition is this one taking
$\mathcal{O}_1$ as the other presheaf we want to tensor).

Immediately after introducing this notion there's the definition of sheaf, then
stalks, abelian sheaves, some other notions like an ``algebraic structure'' and
then tensor product will be defined after sheafification---because the following
definition is in general not a sheaf.

Furthermore, I add that Vakil leaves it as an exercise to define the tensor
product of two $\mathcal{O}_X$ modules (with a hint of defining the presheaf
tensor product and sheafifying), which makes me think that after all it {\it is}
just the intuitive definition. Before diving in, also by Vakil (Exercise 26.K):
the stalk of the tensor product is the tensor product of the stalks.

\medskip\noindent

Suppose that $\mathcal{O}_1 \to \mathcal{O}_2$ is a
morphism of presheaves of rings on $X$. In this case,
if $\mathcal{F}$ is a presheaf of $\mathcal{O}_2$-modules
then we can think of $\mathcal{F}$ as a presheaf of
$\mathcal{O}_1$-modules by using the composition
$$
\mathcal{O}_1 \times \mathcal{F}
\to
\mathcal{O}_2 \times \mathcal{F}
\to
\mathcal{F}.
$$
We sometimes denote this by $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{O}_1}$
to indicate the restriction of rings. We call this
the {\it restriction of $\mathcal{F}$}. We obtain the
restriction functor
$$
\textit{PMod}(\mathcal{O}_2)
\longrightarrow
\textit{PMod}(\mathcal{O}_1)
$$

\medskip\noindent
On the other hand, given a presheaf of $\mathcal{O}_1$-modules
$\mathcal{G}$
we can construct a presheaf of $\mathcal{O}_2$-modules
$\mathcal{O}_2 \otimes_{p, \mathcal{O}_1} \mathcal{G}$
by the rule
$$
\left(\mathcal{O}_2 \otimes_{p, \mathcal{O}_1} \mathcal{G}\right)(U)
=
\mathcal{O}_2(U) \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_1(U)} \mathcal{G}(U)
$$
The index $p$ stands for ``presheaf'' and not ``point''.
This presheaf is called the tensor product presheaf. We obtain
the {\it change of rings} functor
$$
\textit{PMod}(\mathcal{O}_1)
\longrightarrow
\textit{PMod}(\mathcal{O}_2)
$$

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-adjointness-tensor-restrict-presheaves}
With $X$, $\mathcal{O}_1$, $\mathcal{O}_2$, $\mathcal{F}$ and
$\mathcal{G}$ as above there exists a canonical bijection
$$
\Hom_{\mathcal{O}_1}(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{O}_1})
=
\Hom_{\mathcal{O}_2}(
\mathcal{O}_2 \otimes_{p, \mathcal{O}_1} \mathcal{G},
\mathcal{F}
)
$$
In other words, the restriction and change of rings functors
are adjoint to each other.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows from the fact that for a ring map
$A \to B$ the restriction functor and the change
of ring functor are adjoint to each other.
\end{proof}



\section{Locally ringed spaces}
\label{section-locally-ringed-spaces}


\section{Invertible modules (line bundles)}
\label{section-invertible}

\noindent
Similarly to the case of modules over rings
(More on Algebra, Section \ref{more-algebra-section-picard})
we have the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-invertible}
Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be a ringed space. An
{\it invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module} is a sheaf
of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules $\mathcal{L}$ such that
the functor
$$
\textit{Mod}(\mathcal{O}_X) \longrightarrow \textit{Mod}(\mathcal{O}_X),\quad
\mathcal{F} \longmapsto \mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{F}
$$
is an equivalence of categories. We say that $\mathcal{L}$ is
{\it trivial} if it is isomorphic as an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module
to $\mathcal{O}_X$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Lemma \ref{lemma-invertible-is-locally-free-rank-1}
below explains the relationship with locally free modules
of rank $1$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-invertible}
Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be a ringed space. Let $\mathcal{L}$
be an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module. Equivalent are
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{L}$ is invertible, and
\item there exists an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module $\mathcal{N}$
such that
$\mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{N} \cong \mathcal{O}_X$.
\end{enumerate}
In this case $\mathcal{L}$ is locally a direct summand of a finite free
$\mathcal{O}_X$-module and the module $\mathcal{N}$ in (2) is isomorphic to
$\SheafHom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{O}_X)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Then the functor $- \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{L}$
is essentially surjective, hence there exists an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module
$\mathcal{N}$ as in (2). If (2) holds, then the functor
$- \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{N}$ is a quasi-inverse
to the functor $- \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{L}$ and
we see that (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (1) and (2) hold. Denote
$\psi : \mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{N} \to \mathcal{O}_X$
the given isomorphism. Let $x \in X$. Choose an open neighbourhood
$U$ an integer $n \geq 1$ and sections $s_i \in \mathcal{L}(U)$,
$t_i \in \mathcal{N}(U)$ such that $\psi(\sum s_i \otimes t_i) = 1$.
Consider the isomorphisms
$$
\mathcal{L}|_U \to
\mathcal{L}|_U \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_U}
\mathcal{L}|_U \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_U} \mathcal{N}|_U \to \mathcal{L}|_U
$$
where the first arrow sends $s$ to $\sum s_i \otimes s \otimes t_i$
and the second arrow sends $s \otimes s' \otimes t$ to $\psi(s' \otimes t)s$.
We conclude that $s \mapsto \sum \psi(s \otimes t_i)s_i$ is
an automorphism of $\mathcal{L}|_U$. This automorphism factors as
$$
\mathcal{L}|_U \to \mathcal{O}_U^{\oplus n} \to \mathcal{L}|_U
$$
where the first arrow is given by
$s \mapsto (\psi(s \otimes t_1), \ldots, \psi(s \otimes t_n))$
and the second arrow by $(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \mapsto \sum a_i s_i$.
In this way we conclude that $\mathcal{L}|_U$ is a direct summand
of a finite free $\mathcal{O}_U$-module.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (1) and (2) hold. Consider the evaluation map
$$
\mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X}
\SheafHom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{O}_X)
\longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X
$$
To finish the proof of the lemma
we will show this is an isomorphism by checking it induces
isomorphisms on stalks. Let $x \in X$.
Since we know (by the previous paragraph)
that $\mathcal{L}$ is a finitely presented
$\mathcal{O}_X$-module
we can use Lemma \ref{lemma-stalk-internal-hom}
to see that it suffices to show that
$$
\mathcal{L}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{X, x}}
\Hom_{\mathcal{O}_{X, x}}(\mathcal{L}_x, \mathcal{O}_{X, x})
\longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X, x}
$$
is an isomorphism. Since
$\mathcal{L}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{X, x}} \mathcal{N}_x =
(\mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{N})_x =
\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ (Lemma \ref{lemma-stalk-tensor-product})
the desired result follows from
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-invertible}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-pullback-invertible}
Let $f : (X, \mathcal{O}_X) \to (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ be a
morphism of ringed spaces. The pullback $f^*\mathcal{L}$ of an
invertible $\mathcal{O}_Y$-module is invertible.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lemma-invertible}
there exists an $\mathcal{O}_Y$-module $\mathcal{N}$ such that
$\mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_Y} \mathcal{N} \cong \mathcal{O}_Y$.
Pulling back we get
$f^*\mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} f^*\mathcal{N} \cong \mathcal{O}_X$
by Lemma \ref{lemma-tensor-product-pullback}.
Thus $f^*\mathcal{L}$ is invertible by Lemma \ref{lemma-invertible}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-invertible-is-locally-free-rank-1}
Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be a ringed space. Any locally free
$\mathcal{O}_X$-module of rank $1$ is invertible.
If all stalks $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ are local rings, then
the converse holds as well (but in general this is not the case).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The parenthetical statement follows by considering a one point
space $X$ with sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X$ given by a ring $R$.
Then invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules correspond to invertible
$R$-modules, hence as soon as $\Pic(R)$ is not the trivial group,
then we get an example.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $\mathcal{L}$ is locally free of rank $1$ and consider the
evaluation map
$$
\mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X}
\SheafHom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{O}_X)
\longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X
$$
Looking over an open covering trivialization $\mathcal{L}$, we see
that this map is an isomorphism. Hence $\mathcal{L}$ is invertible
by Lemma \ref{lemma-invertible}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume all stalks $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ are local rings and $\mathcal{L}$
invertible. In the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-invertible}
we have seen that $\mathcal{L}_x$ is an invertible
$\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$-module for all $x \in X$. Since
$\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ is local, we see that
$\mathcal{L}_x \cong \mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
(More on Algebra, Section \ref{more-algebra-section-picard}).
Since $\mathcal{L}$ is of finite presentation by
Lemma \ref{lemma-invertible} we conclude that $\mathcal{L}$
is locally free of rank $1$ by
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-presentation-stalk-free}.
\end{proof}

Now I introduce some of the properties of line bundles, Cartier divisors and so
on.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Cartier-effective-and-invertible-sheaf}
The ideal sheaf of an effective Cartier divisor (a subscheme locally defined by
the vanishing of a single function) is an invertible sheaf.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We just need to check that the generator of the ideal sheaf at any affine set is
not a zerodivisor. This follows from the ideal sheaf exact sequence, which
implies that multplication by the generator is injective:
 $$
\xymatrix{
0\ar[r]&I\cong A\ar[r]&A\ar[r]&A/I\ar[r]&0
}
$$
\end{proof}


\section{Ampleness}
\label{section-ampleness}

First is this lemma that comes from modules.tex. I think these sets $X_s$ are
the base points of the bundle. Because look: image of $s$ just means consider
the section $s$ of the line bundle as a germ near $x$. Now a line bundle is a
locally free rank-1 $\mathcal{O}_X$-module, so its sections, like $s$, may be
multiplied by germs of functions in the maximal ring $\mathfrak{m}_x$, i.e. the
functions that vanish at $x$. So $X_s$ is the vanishing locus of the section
$s$. If $s(x)\neq 0$, obviously $s
\not\in\mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{L}_x$, so $x\in X_s$. Conversely, I would like to
show that if $s(x)=0$ then  $s\in\mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{L}_x$ but I'm not sure
how. It's like: a vector field with a zero can be multiplied by a function that
vanishes at the point, sure, but what's this function?

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-s-open}
From modules.tex.
\begin{slogan}
A (local) trivialisation of a linebundle
is the same as a (local) nonvanishing section.
\end{slogan}
Let $X$ be a ringed space. Assume that each stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
is a local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak m_x$.
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
For any section $s \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L})$ the set
$$
X_s = \{x \in X \mid \text{image }s \not\in \mathfrak m_x\mathcal{L}_x\}
$$
is open in $X$. The map $s : \mathcal{O}_{X_s} \to \mathcal{L}|_{X_s}$
is an isomorphism, and there exists a section $s'$
of $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes -1}$ over $X_s$ such that $s' (s|_{X_s}) = 1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $x \in X_s$.
We have an isomorphism
$$
\mathcal{L}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{X, x}} (\mathcal{L}^{\otimes -1})_x
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{O}_{X, x}
$$
by Lemma \ref{lemma-constructions-invertible}.
Both $\mathcal{L}_x$ and $(\mathcal{L}^{\otimes -1})_x$
are free $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$-modules of rank $1$. We conclude
from Algebra, Nakayama's Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-NAK} that
$s_x$ is a basis for $\mathcal{L}_x$. Hence there exists
a basis element $t_x \in (\mathcal{L}^{\otimes -1})_x$
such that $s_x \otimes t_x$ maps to $1$.
Choose an open neighbourhood $U$ of
$x$ such that $t_x$ comes from a section $t$
of $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes -1}$ over $U$ and such that
$s \otimes t$ maps to $1 \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$.
Clearly, for every $x' \in U$ we see that $s$ generates
the module $\mathcal{L}_{x'}$. Hence $U \subset X_s$.
This proves that $X_s$ is open. Moreover, the section
$t$ constructed over $U$ above is unique, and hence
these glue to give the section $s'$ of the lemma.
\end{proof}

Recall from Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-s-open}
that given an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ on a locally ringed
space $X$, and given a global section $s$ of $\mathcal{L}$
the set $X_s = \{x \in X \mid s \not \in \mathfrak m_x\mathcal{L}_x\}$
is open. A general remark is that
$X_s \cap X_{s'} = X_{ss'}$, where $ss'$ denote
the section $s \otimes s' \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L} \otimes \mathcal{L}')$.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-ample}
\begin{reference}
\cite[II Definition 4.5.3]{EGA}
\end{reference}
Let $X$ be a scheme.
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
We say $\mathcal{L}$ is {\it ample} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is quasi-compact, and
\item for every $x \in X$ there exists an $n \geq 1$
and $s \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})$ such
that $x \in X_s$ and $X_s$ is affine.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
\label{exercise-ample-bundle-on-K3}
Let $L$ be an ample bundle on a K3 surface $M$. Prove that
$\mathcal{L}^{\otimes 2}$ is globally generated (that is, for each $x\in M$
there exsits a section $h \in H^{0}(L^{\otimes 2})$ which does not vanish in
$x$).
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
This just asks that the $n$ in Definition \ref{definition-ample} is $2$ for all
$x\in X$. Because, again, $x\in X_s$ means that $s(x)\neq 0$ because if it was,
then we could somehow write $s$ as a product of a vanishing function on
$\mathfrak{m}_x$ and a local frame of $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$. But I guess for
the exercise do this: a line bundle is {\it ample} if there is $n$ such that the
canonical embedding (cf Lemma \ref{lemma-map-into-proj}) is an embedding, i.e.
that $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$ is {\it very ample}. (Interestingly, the notion
very ampleness is defined in morphisms.tex.)
\end{proof}

Now we pass to the part where ampleness gives you an {\bf open immersion} to
some projective space. Because, it's only very ampleness that gives an
embedding, right? (Actually I think here in stacks project there are no
embeddings but closed immersions.)

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-gamma-star}
From modules.tex. Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be a ringed space.
Given an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$ we define
the {\it associated graded ring} to be
$$
\Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L})
=
\bigoplus\nolimits_{n \geq 0} \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})
$$
Given a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules $\mathcal{F}$ we set
$$
\Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{F})
=
\bigoplus\nolimits_{n \in \mathbf{Z}} \Gamma(X,
\mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})
$$
which we think of as a graded $\Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L})$-module.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-map-into-proj}
Let $X$ be a scheme.
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
Set $S = \Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L})$ as a graded ring.
If every point of $X$ is contained in one of the
open subschemes $X_s$, for some $s \in S_{+}$ homogeneous, then
there is a canonical morphism of schemes
$$
f : X \longrightarrow Y = \text{Proj}(S),
$$
to the homogeneous spectrum of $S$ (see
Constructions, Section \ref{constructions-section-proj}).
This morphism has the following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f^{-1}(D_{+}(s)) = X_s$ for any $s \in S_{+}$ homogeneous,
\item there are $\mathcal{O}_X$-module maps
$f^*\mathcal{O}_Y(n) \to \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$
compatible with multiplication maps, see
Constructions, Equation (\ref{constructions-equation-multiply}),
\item the composition
$S_n \to \Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y(n)) \to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})$
is the identity map, and
\item for every $x \in X$ there is an integer $d \geq 1$
and an open neighbourhood $U \subset X$ of $x$
such that $f^*\mathcal{O}_Y(dn)|_U \to \mathcal{L}^{\otimes dn}|_U$
is an isomorphism for all $n \in \mathbf{Z}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Denote $\psi : S \to \Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L})$ the identity map.
We are going to use the triple
$(U(\psi), r_{\mathcal{L}, \psi}, \theta)$ of
Constructions, Lemma \ref{constructions-lemma-invertible-map-into-proj}.
By assumption the open subscheme $U(\psi)$ of equals $X$. Hence
$r_{\mathcal{L}, \psi} : U(\psi) \to Y$ is defined on all of $X$.
We set $f = r_{\mathcal{L}, \psi}$.
The maps in part (2) are the components of $\theta$.
Part (3) follows from condition (2) in the lemma cited above.
Part (1) follows from (3) combined with condition (1) in the lemma
cited above. Part (4) follows from the last statement in
Constructions, Lemma \ref{constructions-lemma-invertible-map-into-proj}
since the map $\alpha$ mentioned there is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-map-into-proj-quasi-compact}
Let $X$ be a scheme. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
Set $S = \Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L})$.
Assume (a) every point of $X$ is contained in one of the
open subschemes $X_s$, for some $s \in S_{+}$ homogeneous,
and (b) $X$ is quasi-compact. Then the canonical morphism of schemes
$f : X \longrightarrow \text{Proj}(S)$ of Lemma \ref{lemma-map-into-proj}
above is quasi-compact with dense image.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
To prove $f$ is quasi-compact it suffices to show that $f^{-1}(D_{+}(s))$
is quasi-compact for any $s \in S_{+}$ homogeneous. Write
$X = \bigcup_{i = 1, \ldots, n} X_i$ as a finite union of
affine opens. By Lemma \ref{lemma-affine-cap-s-open} each intersection
$X_s \cap X_i$ is affine. Hence $X_s = \bigcup_{i = 1, \ldots, n} X_s \cap X_i$
is quasi-compact. Assume that the image of $f$ is not dense to get
a contradiction. Then, since the opens $D_+(s)$ with $s \in S_+$ homogeneous
form a basis for the topology on $\text{Proj}(S)$, we can find such
an $s$ with $D_+(s) \not = \emptyset$ and $f(X) \cap D_+(s) = \emptyset$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-map-into-proj}
this means $X_s = \emptyset$. By Lemma \ref{lemma-invert-s-sections}
this means that a power $s^n$ is the zero section of
$\mathcal{L}^{\otimes n\deg(s)}$.
This in turn means that $D_+(s) = \emptyset$ which is the
desired contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-ample-immersion-into-proj}
Let $X$ be a scheme. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
Set $S = \Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L})$.
Assume $\mathcal{L}$ is ample. Then the canonical morphism of schemes
$f : X \longrightarrow \text{Proj}(S)$ of Lemma \ref{lemma-map-into-proj}
is an open immersion with dense image.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lemma-affine-s-opens-cover-quasi-separated} we see
that $X$ is quasi-separated. Choose finitely many
$s_1, \ldots, s_n \in S_{+}$ homogeneous
such that $X_{s_i}$ are affine, and $X = \bigcup X_{s_i}$.
Say $s_i$ has degree $d_i$. The inverse image of
$D_{+}(s_i)$ under $f$ is $X_{s_i}$, see Lemma \ref{lemma-map-into-proj}.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-invert-s-sections} the ring map
$$
(S^{(d_i)})_{(s_i)} = \Gamma(D_{+}(s_i), \mathcal{O}_{\text{Proj}(S)})
\longrightarrow
\Gamma(X_{s_i}, \mathcal{O}_X)
$$
is an isomorphism. Hence $f$ induces an isomorphism
$X_{s_i} \to D_{+}(s_i)$. Thus $f$ is an isomorphism of $X$ onto the open
subscheme $\bigcup_{i = 1, \ldots, n} D_{+}(s_i)$ of $\text{Proj}(S)$.
The image is dense by Lemma \ref{lemma-map-into-proj-quasi-compact}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-open-in-proj-ample}
Let $X$ be a scheme.
Let $S$ be a graded ring. Assume $X$ is quasi-compact,
and assume there exists an open immersion
$$
j : X \longrightarrow Y = \text{Proj}(S).
$$
Then $j^*\mathcal{O}_Y(d)$ is an invertible ample sheaf
for some $d > 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is Constructions, Lemma \ref{constructions-lemma-ample-on-proj}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-characterize-ample}
Let $X$ be a quasi-compact scheme.
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible sheaf on $X$.
Set $S = \Gamma_*(X, \mathcal{L})$.

\mathcal{F}
$$
with $n \geq 1$ equals $\mathcal{F}$,
\item
\label{item-qc-i-gg}
same property as (\ref{item-qc-gg}) with $\mathcal{F}$
ranging over all quasi-coherent sheaves of ideals,
\item
\label{item-c-gg}
$X$ is quasi-separated and
for every quasi-coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of finite type on $X$
there exists an integer $n_0$ such that
$\mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$
is globally generated for all $n \geq n_0$,
\item
\label{item-c-q}
$X$ is quasi-separated and

there exist integers $n > 0$, $k \geq 0$ such that
$\mathcal{F}$ is a quotient of a direct sum of $k$ copies of
$\mathcal{L}^{\otimes - n}$, and
\item
\label{item-c-i-q}
same as in (\ref{item-c-q}) with $\mathcal{F}$ ranging over all
sheaves of ideals of finite type on $X$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Lemma \ref{lemma-ample-immersion-into-proj} is
(\ref{item-ample}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{item-immersion}).
Lemmas \ref{lemma-ample-power-ample} and \ref{lemma-open-in-proj-ample}
provide the implication
(\ref{item-ample}) $\Leftarrow$ (\ref{item-immersion}).
The implications (\ref{item-immersion}) $\Rightarrow$
(\ref{item-s-affine-basis}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{item-s-basis})
are clear from Constructions, Section \ref{constructions-section-proj}.
Lemma \ref{lemma-affine-s-opens} is
(\ref{item-s-basis}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{item-ample}).
Thus we see that the first 4 conditions are all equivalent.

\medskip\noindent
Assume the equivalent conditions (1) -- (4).
Note that in particular $X$ is separated (as an open
subscheme of the separated scheme $\text{Proj}(S)$).
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$.
Choose $s \in S_{+}$ homogeneous such that $X_s$ is affine.
We claim that any section $m \in \Gamma(X_s, \mathcal{F})$
is in the image of one of the maps displayed in
(\ref{item-qc-gg}) above. This will imply (\ref{item-qc-gg})
since these affines $X_s$ cover $X$.
Namely, by Lemma \ref{lemma-invert-s-sections} we may write
$m$ as the image of $m' \otimes s^{-n}$ for some
$n \geq 1$, some
$m' \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})$.
This proves the claim.

\medskip\noindent
Clearly (\ref{item-qc-gg}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{item-qc-i-gg}).
Let us assume (\ref{item-qc-i-gg}) and prove $\mathcal{L}$ is
ample. Pick $x \in X$. Let $U \subset X$ be an affine open
which contains $x$. Set $Z = X \setminus U$. We may think of
$Z$ as a reduced closed subscheme, see
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-reduced}.
Let $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ be the quasi-coherent
sheaf of ideals corresponding to the closed subscheme $Z$.
By assumption (\ref{item-qc-i-gg}), there exists an $n \geq 1$ and a section
$s \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{I} \otimes \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})$
such that $s$ does not vanish at $x$ (more precisely such that
$s \not \in \mathfrak m_x \mathcal{I}_x \otimes \mathcal{L}_x^{\otimes n}$).
We may think of $s$ as a section of $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$.
Since it clearly vanishes along $Z$ we see that
$X_s \subset U$. Hence $X_s$ is affine, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-affine-cap-s-open}.
This proves that $\mathcal{L}$ is ample.
At this point we have proved that (1) -- (6) are equivalent.

\medskip\noindent
Assume the equivalent conditions (1) -- (6). In the following
we will use the fact that the tensor product of two sheaves of
modules which are globally generated is globally generated without
further mention (see
Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-tensor-product-globally-generated}).
By (1) we can find elements $s_i \in S_{d_i}$ with $d_i \geq 1$
such that $X = \bigcup_{i = 1, \ldots, n} X_{s_i}$.
Set $d = d_1\ldots d_n$. It follows that $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes d}$
is globally generated by
$$
s_1^{d/d_1}, \ldots, s_n^{d/d_n}.
$$
This means that if $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes j}$ is globally generated
then so is $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes j + dn}$ for all $n \geq 0$.
Fix a $j \in \{0, \ldots, d - 1\}$. For any point $x \in X$ there
exists an $n \geq 1$ and a global section $s$ of $\mathcal{L}^{j + dn}$
which does not vanish at $x$, as follows from (\ref{item-qc-gg}) applied
to $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{L}^{\otimes j}$ and ample invertible
sheaf $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes d}$. Since $X$ is quasi-compact there
we may find a finite list of integers $n_i$ and global sections
$s_i$ of $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes j + dn_i}$ which do not vanish at any point
of $X$. Since $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes d}$ is globally generated this means that
$\mathcal{L}^{\otimes j + dn}$ is globally generated where $n = \max\{n_i\}$.
Since we proved this for every congruence class mod $d$ we
conclude that there exists an $n_0 = n_0(\mathcal{L})$ such that
$\mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$ is globally generated for all $n \geq n_0$.
At this point we see that if $\mathcal{F}$ is globally generated then
so is $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$ for all
$n \geq n_0$.

\medskip\noindent
We continue to assume the equivalent conditions (1) -- (6).
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent
sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules of finite type.
Denote $\mathcal{F}_n \subset \mathcal{F}$ the image of the canonical
map of (\ref{item-qc-gg}). By construction
$\mathcal{F}_n \otimes \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$ is
globally generated. By (\ref{item-qc-gg}) we see
$\mathcal{F}$ is the sum of the subsheaves $\mathcal{F}_n$,
$n \geq 1$. By
Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-finite-type-quasi-compact-colimit}
we see that $\mathcal{F} = \sum_{n = 1, \ldots, N} \mathcal{F}_n$
for some $N \geq 1$. It follows that
$\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$ is globally
generated whenever $n \geq N + n_0(\mathcal{L})$ with $n_0(\mathcal{L})$
as above. We conclude that (1) -- (6) implies (\ref{item-c-gg}).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (\ref{item-c-gg}). Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent
sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules of finite type.
By (\ref{item-c-gg}) there exists an integer $n \geq 1$ such that
the canonical map
$$
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})
\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes -n}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{F}
$$
is surjective. Let $I$ be the set of finite subsets of
$\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n})$
partially ordered by inclusion. Then $I$ is a directed partially ordered set.
For $i = \{s_1, \ldots, s_{r(i)}\}$ let $\mathcal{F}_i \subset \mathcal{F}$
be the image of the map
$$
\bigoplus\nolimits_{j = 1, \ldots, r(i)} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes -n}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{F}
$$
which is multiplication by $s_j$ on the $j$th factor. The surjectivity above
implies that $\mathcal{F} = \colim_{i \in I} \mathcal{F}_i$.
Hence Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-finite-type-quasi-compact-colimit}
applies and we conclude that
$\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_i$ for some $i$.
Hence we have proved (\ref{item-c-q}). In other words,
(\ref{item-c-gg}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{item-c-q}).

\medskip\noindent
The implication (\ref{item-c-q}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{item-c-i-q}) is trivial.

\medskip\noindent
Finally, assume (\ref{item-c-i-q}).
Let $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf
of ideals. By Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-coherent-colimit-finite-type}
(this is where we use the condition that $X$ be quasi-separated)
we see that $\mathcal{I} = \colim_\alpha I_\alpha$ with
each $I_\alpha$ quasi-coherent of finite type. Since by assumption each of
the $I_\alpha$ is a quotient of negative tensor powers of
$\mathcal{L}$ we conclude the same for $\mathcal{I}$ (but of course
without the finiteness or boundedness of the powers). Hence
we conclude that (\ref{item-c-i-q}) implies (\ref{item-qc-i-gg}).
This ends the proof of the proposition.
\end{proof}

The following proofs were used for Exercise 
\ref{complex-geometry-exercise-L-ample-implies-Lotimes2-globally-generated}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-divisor-has-sections-implies-deg-geq-0}
Let $D$ be a divisor on a complete, nonsingular curve $X$. 
If  $h^0(D)\neq 0$ then $\text{deg}D\geq0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $D$ has sections, we can take the zero locus of any of its sections to
produce an effective divisor linearly equivalent to $D$. Since degree depends
only on linear equivalence and effective divisors have non negative degree.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-divisor-is-base-point-free-iff-dimension-condition}
\begin{reference}
\cite[IV, Proposition 3.1(a)]{hart}
\end{reference}
Let $D$ be a divisor on a complete, nonsingular curve $X$. 
Then the complete linear system has no base
points if and only if for every point $P\in X$,
$$
\dim|D-P|=\dim|D|-1
$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
To show that $D$ has no base points amounts to showing that not every section of
$D$. That is, that the injective map $0\to H^{0}(D-p)\to H^{0}(D)$ is not 
surjective.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-degree-of-divisor-geq-2g-implies-base-point-free}
\begin{reference}
\cite[IV, Corollary 3.2(a), Examples 1.3.3, 1.3.4]{hart}
\end{reference}
Let $D$ be a divisor on a curve $X$ of genus $g$. 
If $\text{deg}D\geq 2g$, then
$|D|$ has no base points.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First we prove that $\text{deg}D\geq 2g$ implies that $D$ and $D-P$ are  
{\it nonspecial}, i.e. that
$h^0(K-D)=0=h^0(K-(D-P))$. Then we apply Riemann-Roch to both $D$ and $D-P$ and
the fact that  $\text{deg}(D-P)=\text{deg}(D)-1$ to find that
$\dim|D-P|=\dim|D|-1$ and apply Proposition 
\ref{proposition-divisor-is-base-point-free-iff-dimension-condition}.

To prove that $D$ is nonspecial first apply Riemann-Roch to $K$ to obtain that
$\text{deg}K=2g-2$. Indeed, $h^0(0)=1$ and $h^0(K)=p_g$ by Serre duality on
$H^1(\mathcal{O}_X)$ recalling definition of genus as $h^1(\mathcal{O}_X)$. 
Then apply Riemann-Roch to both $D$ and  $K-D$ to prove
that $\text{deg}D>2g-2$ implies $\text{deg}(K-D)<0$; start with
$$
h^0(K-D)-h^0(K-(K-D))=-(h^0(D)-h^0(K-D))
$$
An analogous result will be valid for $D-P$ since its degree is also greater
than $2g-2$.

Then apply Lemma
\ref{lemma-divisor-has-sections-implies-deg-geq-0}.
\end{proof}

\section{Closed immersions of locally ringed spaces}
\label{section-closed-immersion}

\noindent
We follow our conventions introduced in
Modules, Definition \ref{modules-definition-closed-immersion}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-closed-immersion-locally-ringed-spaces}
Let $i : Z \to X$ be a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
We say that $i$ is a {\it closed immersion} if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The map $i$ is a homeomorphism of $Z$ onto a closed subset of $X$.
\item The map $\mathcal{O}_X \to i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ is surjective;
let $\mathcal{I}$ denote the kernel.
\item The $\mathcal{O}_X$-module $\mathcal{I}$
is locally generated by sections.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-closed-immersion-locally-ringed-spaces}
Let $i : Z \to X$ be a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
We say that $i$ is a {\it closed immersion} if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The map $i$ is a homeomorphism of $Z$ onto a closed subset of $X$.
\item The map $\mathcal{O}_X \to i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ is surjective;
let $\mathcal{I}$ denote the kernel.
\item The $\mathcal{O}_X$-module $\mathcal{I}$
is locally generated by sections.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-local-target}
Let $f : Z \to X$ be a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
In order for $f$ to be a closed immersion it suffices
that there exists an open covering $X = \bigcup U_i$ such
that each $f : f^{-1}U_i \to U_i$ is a closed immersion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-closed-subspace}
Let $X$ be a locally ringed space.
Let $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ be a sheaf
of ideals which is locally generated by sections as a sheaf
of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. Let $Z$ be the support of
the sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I}$.
This is a closed subset of $X$, by
Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-support-sheaf-rings-closed}.
Denote $i : Z \to X$ the inclusion map.
By Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-i-star-exact}
there is a unique sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_Z$ on $Z$
with $i_*\mathcal{O}_Z = \mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I}$.
For any $z \in Z$ the stalk $\mathcal{O}_{Z, z}$
is equal to a quotient $\mathcal{O}_{X, i(z)}/\mathcal{I}_{i(z)}$
of a local ring and nonzero, hence a local ring.
Thus $i : (Z, \mathcal{O}_Z) \to (X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ is
a closed immersion of locally ringed spaces.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-closed-subspace}
Let $X$ be a locally ringed space.
Let $\mathcal{I}$ be a sheaf of ideals on $X$
which is locally generated by sections.
The locally ringed space $(Z, \mathcal{O}_Z)$
of Example \ref{example-closed-subspace} above
is the {\it closed subspace of $X$ associated to
the sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I}$}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-immersion}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a closed immersion of
locally ringed spaces. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the
kernel of the map $\mathcal{O}_Y \to f_*\mathcal{O}_X$.
Let $i : Z \to Y$ be the closed subspace of $Y$
associated to $\mathcal{I}$.
There is a unique isomorphism $f' : X \cong Z$ of
locally ringed spaces such that $f = i \circ f'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-closed-subspace}
Let $X$, $Y$ be locally ringed spaces. Let
$\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ be a sheaf of ideals locally generated
by sections. Let $i : Z \to X$ be the associated closed subspace.
A morphism $f : Y \to X$ factors through $Z$ if and only if the map
$f^*\mathcal{I} \to f^*\mathcal{O}_X = \mathcal{O}_Y$
is zero. If this is the case the morphism $g : Y \to Z$
such that $f = i \circ g$ is unique.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Clearly if $f$ factors as $Y \to Z \to X$ then the map
$f^*\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_Y$ is zero. Conversely
suppose that $f^*\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_Y$ is zero.
Pick any $y \in Y$, and consider the ring map
$f^\sharp_y : \mathcal{O}_{X, f(y)} \to \mathcal{O}_{Y, y}$.
Since the composition
$\mathcal{I}_{f(y)} \to \mathcal{O}_{X, f(y)} \to \mathcal{O}_{Y, y}$
is zero by assumption and since $f^\sharp_y(1) = 1$
we see that $1 \not \in \mathcal{I}_{f(y)}$, i.e.,
$\mathcal{I}_{f(y)} \not = \mathcal{O}_{X, f(y)}$. We conclude that
$f(Y) \subset Z = \text{Supp}(\mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I})$.
Hence $f = i \circ g$ where $g : Y \to Z$ is continuous.
Consider the map $f^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_X \to f_*\mathcal{O}_Y$.
The assumption $f^*\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_Y$ is zero implies that
the composition $\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_X \to f_*\mathcal{O}_Y$ is
zero by adjointness of $f_*$ and $f^*$.
In other words, we obtain a morphism of sheaves of rings
$\overline{f^\sharp} : \mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I} \to f_*\mathcal{O}_Y$.
Note that $f_*\mathcal{O}_Y = i_*g_*\mathcal{O}_Y$ and
that $\mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I} = i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$.
By Sheaves, Lemma \ref{sheaves-lemma-equivalence-categories-closed-structures}
we obtain a unique morphism of sheaves of rings
$g^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_Z \to g_*\mathcal{O}_Y$ whose pushforward
under $i$ is $\overline{f^\sharp}$. We omit the verification that
$(g, g^\sharp)$ defines a morphism of locally ringed spaces
and that $f = i \circ g$ as a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
The uniqueness of $(g, g^\sharp)$ was pointed out above.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-restrict-map-to-closed}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
Let $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_Y$ be a sheaf of
ideals which is locally generated by sections.
Let $i : Z \to Y$ be the closed subspace associated to the
sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I}$.
Let $\mathcal{J}$ be the image of the map
$f^*\mathcal{I} \to f^*\mathcal{O}_Y = \mathcal{O}_X$.
Then this ideal is locally generated by sections.
Moreover, let $i' : Z' \to X$ be the associated closed
subspace of $X$. There exists a unique
morphism of locally ringed spaces $f' : Z' \to Z$ such
that the following diagram is a commutative square of
locally ringed spaces
$$
\xymatrix{
Z' \ar[d]_{f'} \ar[r]_{i'} & X \ar[d]^f \\
Z \ar[r]^{i} & Y
}
$$
Moreover, this diagram is a fibre square in the category of
locally ringed spaces.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The ideal $\mathcal{J}$ is locally generated by sections
by Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-pullback-locally-generated}.
The rest of the lemma follows from the characterization,
in Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-closed-subspace} above,
of what it means for a morphism to factor through a closed
subspace.
\end{proof}

\section{Dominant morphisms}
\label{section-dominant}

\noindent
The definition of a morphism of schemes being dominant is a little
different from what you might expect if you are used to the notion
of a dominant morphism of varieties.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-dominant}
A morphism $f : X \to S$ of schemes is called {\it dominant} if the
image of $f$ is a dense subset of $S$.
\end{definition}

\section{Morphisms of finite type}
\label{section-finite-type}

\noindent
Recall that a ring map $R \to A$ is said to be of finite type if
$A$ is isomorphic to a quotient of $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ as an $R$-algebra, see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-finite-type}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-finite-type}
Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that $f$ is of {\it finite type at $x \in X$} if
there exists an affine open neighbourhood $\Spec(A) = U \subset X$
of $x$ and an affine open $\Spec(R) = V \subset S$
with $f(U) \subset V$ such that the induced ring map
$R \to A$ is of finite type.
\item We say that $f$ is {\it locally of finite type} if it is
of finite type at every point of $X$.
\item We say that $f$ is of {\it finite type} if it is locally of
finite type and quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\section{Normalization}
\label{section-normalization}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-normalization-X-in-Y}
Let $f : Y \to X$ be a quasi-compact and quasi-separated morphism of schemes.
Let $\mathcal{O}'$ be the integral closure of $\mathcal{O}_X$ in
$f_*\mathcal{O}_Y$. The {\it normalization of $X$ in $Y$} is the
scheme\footnote{The scheme $X'$ need not be normal, for example if
$Y = X$ and $f = \text{id}_X$, then $X' = X$.}
$$
\nu : X' = \underline{\Spec}_X(\mathcal{O}') \to X
$$
over $X$. It comes equipped with a natural factorization
$$
Y \xrightarrow{f'} X' \xrightarrow{\nu} X
$$
of the initial morphism $f$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
The factorization is the composition of the canonical morphism
$Y \to \underline{\Spec}_X(f_*\mathcal{O}_Y)$ (see
Constructions, Lemma
\ref{constructions-lemma-canonical-morphism})
and the morphism of relative spectra coming from the inclusion map
$\mathcal{O}' \to f_*\mathcal{O}_Y$. We can characterize the
normalization as follows.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-normalization}
Let $f : Y \to X$ be a quasi-compact and quasi-separated morphism of schemes.
The factorization $f = \nu \circ f'$, where $\nu : X' \to X$ is the
normalization of $X$ in $Y$ is characterized by the following
two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the morphism $\nu$ is integral, and
\item for any factorization $f = \pi \circ g$, with $\pi : Z \to X$
integral, there exists a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
Y \ar[d]_{f'} \ar[r]_g & Z \ar[d]^\pi \\
X' \ar[ru]^h \ar[r]^\nu & X
}
$$
for some unique morphism $h : X' \to Z$.
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, the morphism $f' : Y \to X'$ is dominant and in (2) the
morphism $h : X' \to Z$ is the normalization of $Z$ in $Y$.
\end{lemma}



\section{Reflexive sheaves}
\label{section-reflexive-sheaves}

\begin{slogan}
These are vector bundles except for a small locus.
\end{slogan}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-reflexive}
Let $X$ be an integral locally Noetherian scheme. Let $\mathcal{F}$
be a coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module. The {\it reflexive hull}
of $\mathcal{F}$ is the $\mathcal{O}_X$-module
$$
\mathcal{F}^{**} = \SheafHom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(
\SheafHom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{O}_X), \mathcal{O}_X)
$$
We say $\mathcal{F}$ is {\it reflexive} if the natural map
$j : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^{**}$
is an isomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-reflexive-torsion-free}
Let $X$ be an integral locally Noetherian scheme. Let $\mathcal{F}$
be a coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\mathcal{F}$ is reflexive, then $\mathcal{F}$ is torsion free.
\item The map $j : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^{**}$
is injective if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is torsion free.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}[Talk at IMPA, 11 June]\leavevmode
\label{remark-reflexive-talk}
Torsion could also be defined so that the sheaf can inject onto its dual. In
this talk we discussed the moduli space of reflexive/torsion-free sheaves, which
turned out to be parametrized by $c_1, c_2$ and $c_3$. This was denoted by 
$R(c_1,c_2,c_3)$. Actually I think it may have been Manolache that proved the
existence of this moduli space.

Nesta palestra discutiremos a classificação de feixes reflexivos de posto dois e
seus espaços de módulos. Apresentaremos algumas ferramentas básicas usadas na
construção e determinação de tais feixes. Aplicaremos estas técnicas para o caso
de feixes com segunda classe de Chern igual a quatro, obtido recentemente em
colaboração com Marcos Jardim.

\subsection{Distributions on manifolds}
\label{subsection-distributions-on-manifolds}

Here's the abstract from a talk by Marcos Jardim at Geometric Structures:

``I will revise the work done over the past 10 years with various collaborators
on distributions and foliations on 3-folds, especially on the projective space,
with a focus on properties of the tangent sheaf and singular scheme."

Here are two key ideas: if the distribution is codimension 1 we can write:
$$
\xymatrix{
0\ar[r]&F\ar[r]&TX\ar[r]^{\omega}&I_Z \otimes L\ar[r]&0
}
$$
where $L$ is a line bundle and $\omega \in H^{0}(\Omega_X \otimes L)$, and
$Z=\{p:\omega(p)=0\}$.

When codimension is 2 then $\mathcal{D}$ is given by a holomorphic vector field 
$\nu$: $T_p=\left<\nu(p)\right>$.

It can be encoded as an exact sequence
$$
\xymatrix{
	0\ar[r]&L\ar[r]^{\nu}&TX\ar[r]&N\ar[r]&0
}
$$
where $L$ is a line bundle and $\nu \in H^{0}(TX \otimes L^\vee)$;
  $Z=\{p | \nu(p) = 0\}$.

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-stauration}
Saturation means that $Z \subset X$ is a union of curves and points.
\end{remark}

And again, distributions are parametrized by Chern classes.

Two interesting open questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Conjeture.} if $\mathcal{D}$ is a codimension 1 foliation of degree
$d$ on $\mathbb{P}^3$, then $c_2(F)\leq d^2-d+1$ and bound is attained
by rational foliations of type $(1,d+1)$. (True for $d \leq 2$.)
\item {\bf Conjecture (with Pepe Seade).} $\mathcal{D}$ is a codimension 1 
foliation on a smooth projective 3-fold, then $\text{Sing}\mathcal{D}$ is connected.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}[Jardim-Muniz]
\label{theorem-jardim-muniz}
Conditions on Chern classes used to understand moduli space $R(c_1,c_2,c_3)$.
$c_2=4$ gives (?). For $c_3\leq 6$, possible ``spectrum" exists…

\section{Stability}
\label{section-stability}

{\bf Question.} What is stability?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Stable objects in an abelian category are the ``building blocks":
we can reconstruct the whole category from them.
\item  An abelian subcategory (hart) $\subset$ a triangulated
\item stability defined via stability function on $\mathcal{A}$.
\item Q. Can we reconstruct $\mathcal{T}$ from the semistable elements of
$\mathcal{A}$
\item {\bf Example.} $\mathcal{A}=\text{Coh}X$ is heart of $D^b(X)$
w/ funny function.
\item Stability condition is hart + stability function.
\item Bridgeland Stabl:= the stability conditions are a complex manifold
of complex codimension $\text{rk}\Lambda$:
$$
 \mathcal{Z}:\text{Stab}(\mathcal{T})
\longrightarrow \text{Hom}(\Lambda,\mathbb{C})
$$
\item There's a chamber structure; moduli space changes across chambers.
\item I think we typically think of vectors in $\text{Hom}(\Lambda,\mathbb{C})$ 
as Chern classes, to characterize the moduli spaces.
\item Existence: given a projective variety $X$, are there stability
conditions on $D^\text{b}(X)$? Yes for fano 3fold pic rk 1.
\item Moduli spaces: is $M_\sigma(v)$ a projective scheme? Cannot use
usual git techniques to study. A stack!
\item Picture: blue + black are walls. Q. What are $\beta$ and $\alpha$?
\item thm: bridgeland stable = gieseker stable ?
\item Q. slope stability = bridgeland stability? A. Not always.
\item DT/PT correspondance: only one wall between PT and G chambers
\medskip
\item Polynomial stability function. This is an asymptotic version of BS.
\item There are some $\rho$'s. Arrangements of $\rho_i$ are polynomial 
stability conditions on a threefold.
\item Pata-Thomas introduced stability for rank 1 objects.
Bayer compares the---wall. Q. Same for Bridge S---only one wall?
\item Recall Gieseker stability.
\medskip
\item Def. A {\it stable triple}: when
$\text{gcd}(\text{ch}_0,\text{ch}_2,\text{ch}_3)=1$, every PT stable object
comes from three conditions (missing).
\item What happens when you cross the blue wall? 
Both $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are projective. What happens at the blue
wall?
\medskip
\item For $X$ smooth threefold with $\text{rk}\text{Pic}=1$, $\mathcal{G}(v)$,
$v=(r,0,0,-n)$, $\mathcal{G}(v)$ is a known sheaf object and
$\mathcal{T}=\emptyset$.
\item $X$ sm 3 rkpic1, Fake wall; $\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{T}$.
\item (Extra.) red circle is a wall for a weaker form of stability.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{definition}[Talk at impa]
\label{definition-slope-stability}
A rank-2 sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ is {\it semistable (stable)}if
$H^{0}(\mathcal{F}(t))=0$ for $-t \geq(>) \frac{c_1F}{2}$
\end{definition}

Compare with

\begin{definition}[moduli-curves.tex]
\label{definition-semistable}
Let $f : X \to S$ be a family of curves.
We say $f$ is a {\it semistable family of curves} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X \to S$ is a prestable family of curves, and
\item $X_s$ has genus $\geq 1$ and
does not have a rational tail for all $s \in S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\section{Coherent sheaves}
\label{section-coherent-sheaves}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-coherent-affine-cohomology-zero}
\begin{slogan}
Serre vanishing: Higher cohomology vanishes on affine schemes
for quasi-coherent modules.
\end{slogan}
Let $X$ be a scheme.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
For any affine open $U \subset X$ we have
$H^p(U, \mathcal{F}) = 0$ for all $p > 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We are going to apply
Cohomology, Lemma \ref{cohomology-lemma-cech-vanish-basis}.
As our basis $\mathcal{B}$ for the topology of $X$ we are going to use
the affine opens of $X$.
As our set $\text{Cov}$ of open coverings we are going to use the standard
open coverings of affine opens of $X$.
Next we check that conditions (1), (2) and (3) of
Cohomology, Lemma \ref{cohomology-lemma-cech-vanish-basis}
hold. Note that the intersection of standard opens in an affine is
another standard open. Hence property (1) holds.
The coverings form a cofinal system of open coverings of any element
of $\mathcal{B}$, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-standard-open}.
Hence (2) holds.
Finally, condition (3) of the lemma follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-cech-cohomology-quasi-coherent-trivial}.
\end{proof}

\section{Hilbert polynomial}
\label{section-Hilbert-polynomial}

The fact that $M$ is finitely generated is what makes the following two
definitions make sense.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-Hilbert-function}
The {\it Hilbert function} of a finitely generated graded $S=k[x_0,\ldots,x_r]$ 
-module $M$ is
$$
H_M(d)=\dim_kM_d
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-sysygy}
Define $F_0$ to be the free $S$-module on the generators of $M$. Elements in the
 kernel $M_1$ of the inclusion are called {\it sysygies}. By Hilbert's basis
theorem, $M_1$ is also finitely generated, so we may choose a set of generators
and repeat this process.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Hilbert Syzygy Theorem]
\label{theorem-Hilbert-syzygy}
\begin{reference}
\cite[Theorem 1.1]{sys}
\end{reference}
Any finitely generated $S$-module $M$ has a finite graded free resolution
$$
\xymatrix{
0\ar[r]&F_m\ar[r]^{\varphi_m}&\ar[r]&F_{m-q}\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r]&
F_1\ar[r]^{\varphi_1}&F_0
}
$$
Moreover, we may take $m\leq r+1$, the number of variables in $S$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Hilbert-function}
Suppose that $S=k[x_0,\ldots,x_r]$ is a polynomial ring. If the graded
$S$-module $M$ has finite free resolution
$$
\xymatrix{
0\ar[r]&F_m\ar[r]^{\varphi_m}&F_{m-1}\ar\cdots[r]&F_1\ar[r]^{\varphi_1}&
\ar[r]&F_0
}
$$
with each $F_i$ a finitely generated free module,
$F_i=\bigoplus_{j}S(-a_{i,j})$, then
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-Hilbert-function}
H_M(d)=\sum_{i=0}(-1)^i\sum_{j}\binom{r+d-a_{i,j}}{r}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Hilbert-function-becomes-polynomial}
There is a polynomial $P_M(d)$ called the {\it Hilbert polynomial} such that, if
$M$ has free resolution as above, then $P_M(d)=H_M(d)$ for 
$d\geq\text{max}_{i,j}\{a_{i,j}-r\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
When $d$ satisfies this bound then the binomial coefficients in Eq.
\ref{equation-Hilbert-function} are polynomials of degree $r$ in $d$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Hilbert-Serre]
\label{theorem-Hilbert-Serre}
\begin{reference}
\cite[I, Theorem 7.5]{hart}
\end{reference}
Let $M$ be a finitely generated graded $S=k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$. Then there exists
a unique polynomial $p_M$ such that $p_M(\ell)=\dim S_\ell$ for large enough
$\ell$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-Hilbert-polynomial}
\begin{reference}
\cite[I, p. 52]{har}
\end{reference}
The polynomial $P_M$ of Hilbert-Serre Theorem \cite{Hilbert-Serre} is the {\it
Hilbert polynomial} of the finitely generated $k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$-module $M$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-degree-of-projective-variety}
\begin{reference}
\cite[p. 52]{hart}
\end{reference}
If $Y\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ is an algebraic set of dimension $r$, we define the
{\it degree of $Y$} to be $r!$ times the leading coefficient of the Hilbert
polynomial of the homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
\label{exercise-very-ample-bundle-self-intersection-is-degree-of-surface}
\begin{reference}
\cite[V, Exercise 1.2]{har}
\end{reference}
Let $H$ be a very ample divisor on the surface $X$, corresponding to a
projective embedding $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^N$. If we write the Hilbert
polynomial of $X$ as $P(z)=\frac{1}{2}az^2+bz+c$, show that $a=H^2$,
$b=\frac{1}{2}H^2+1-\pi$, where $\pi$ is the genus of a nonsingular curve
representing $H$, and $c=1+p_a$.
\end{exercise}

\section{Nakai-Moishezon Criterion}
\label{section-Nakai-Moishezon-criterion}

\begin{theorem}[Nakai-Moishezon Criterion]
\label{theorem-Nakai-Moishezon-criterion}
\begin{reference}
\cite[V, Theorem 1.10]{hart}
\end{reference}
A divisor $D$ on the surface $X$ is ample if and only if $D^2>0$ and $D.C>0$ for
all irreducible curves $C$ in $X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The direct implication is easy: since $D$ is ample,  $mD$ is very ample for some
$m$, so that $m^2D^2$ is the self-intersection number of $mD$. By exercise
\ref{exercise-very-ample-bundle-self-intersection-is-degree-of-surface},
 $D^2$ is the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of $X$ as a 
subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n$. This means that $D^2$ is twice the leading
coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of a projective variety for large enough
$m$, so that it must be a positive number (it's the dimension of one of the
graded components of the coordinate ring of the surface).
\end{proof}

\section{Fano varieties}
\label{section-Fano-varieties}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-Fano-variety}
A {\it Fano variety} is a projective variety with $-K_X$ ample.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-Fano-index}
$$
r(X):=\text{min}\{r:\frac{c_1(X)}{r}\in H^{2}(X,\mathbb{Z})\}
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
\label{exercise-Fano-vanishing-higher-cohomology}
By Kodaira vanishing theorem \ref{theorem-Kodaira-vanishing}, 
you can show that the cohomology $H^{i}(X,L)$ for
a Fano variety $X$ vanishes. You just have to put $L=\mathcal{O}(k)$ with $k\geq
-r$, where $r$ is the Fano index.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{exercise-Pic-H2-Fano}
Show that  $\text{Pic}(X)\cong H^{2}(X,\mathbb{Z})$ holds for Fano varieties.
\end{exercise}
