\begin{proposition}[Unique lifting property]
\label{proposition-unique-lifting-property}
\cite{hat}, Proposition 1.34. Given a covering space $p:\tilde{X} \to X$ and a
map $f:Y \to X$, if two lifts $\tilde{f}_1,\tilde{f}_2:Y \to \tilde{X}$ of $f$
agree at one point of $Y$ and $Y$ is connected, then $\tilde{f}_1$ and
$\tilde{f}_2$ agree on all of $Y$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We aim to show that the set of points where $\tilde{f}_1$ and $\tilde{f}_2$
agree is both open and closed in $Y$. Let $y \in Y$ and consider an evenly
covered neighbourhood $U$ of $f(y)$, so that $p^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of
sets, each of which is homeomorphic to $U$ via $p$. Let $\tilde{U}_1$ and
$\tilde{U}_2$ be the sheets containing $\tilde{f}_1(y)$ and $\tilde{f}_2(y)$,
respectively. By continuity of $\tilde{f}_1$ and $\tilde{f}_2$, the intersection
$\tilde{f}^{-1}_1(\tilde{U}_1) \cap \tilde{f}_2^{-1}(\tilde{U}_2):=N$ is 
 an open neighbourhood of $y$.

Since  $\tilde{U}_1$ and $\tilde{U}_2$ are mapped homeomorphically to the set
$U \subset X$, we can only have that either $\tilde{U}_1$ coincides
with $\tilde{U}_2$, or they are disjoint. If they are disjoint, then the 
neighbourhood $N$ shows that the set of points where $\tilde{f}_1$ and
$\tilde{f}_2$ agree is closed; that's because in this case they don't agree at a
point, so that we are on the complement of the set where they agree, and we have
shown it's an open set (every point has a neighbourhood contained in the set).

If, on the other hand, $\tilde{U}_1$ and $\tilde{U}_2$ are the same, which
happens when $\tilde{f}_1(y)=\tilde{f}_2(y)$, then $\tilde{f}_1$ and 
$\tilde{f}_2$ agree throughout $N$, so that we have shown that the set where
$\tilde{f}_1$ and $\tilde{f}_2$ coincide is open.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Properly discontinuous action]
\label{definition-properly-discontinuous-action}
See \cite{hat} p. 72. The action of a group $G$ on a space $Y$ is called 
{\it properly discontinuous} or {\it covering space action} if each $y \in Y$
has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $g_1(U) \cap g_2(U)\neq \emptyset$ for any
$g_1,g_2 \in G$ implies $g_1=g_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-deck-transformations-act-properly-discontinuous}
The action of deck transformations on a covering space is a properly
discontinuous action.
