\begin{exercise}
\label{exercise-square-of-ample-bundle-on-K3-is-globally-generated}
Let $L$ be an ample bundle on a K3 surface $M$. Prove that $L^{\otimes 2}$ is
globally generated (that is, for each $x\in M$ there exists a section $h\in
H^{0}(L^{\otimes2})$ which does not vanish in $x$).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{exercise-deformation-space-of-smooth-curve-on-K3-
has-dimension-bounded-by-genus}
Let $S$ be a smooth genus $g$ curve which can be embedded in a K3 surface $M$,
and $X$ the family of all deformations of $S$ in $M$. Prove that $\dim X\leq g$.

\begin{exercise}
\label{exercise-singular-irreducible-curve-on-K3-non-negative-self-intersection}
Let $S \subset M$ be a singular, irreducible complex curve on a K3 surface.
Prove that $(S,S)\geq 0$
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
This follows from Proposition 
\ref{proposition-adjunction-formula-curves-on-surfaces}, which says that
for any curve $S$ on a smooth surface $S$:
$$
2p_a(S)-2=S\cdot (S+K_M)
$$
In our case, since $K_M \cong\mathcal{O}_M$, this shows that $(S.S)\geq 0$
provided $p_a(S) \neq 0$. This is the case since, for a singular curve like $S$,
the arithmetic genus $p_a(S)$ is defined to be the genus of the normalization
 $\tilde{S}$. In turn, the cokernel of the induced map by the normalization
(cf \cite{sea} 28.5.4) is zero sheaf iff and only if the genus of $S$ coincides
with the genus of $\tilde{S}$, but this is not true as long as $S$ has
singularitiesâ€¦ the cokernel is supported on a finite set of closed points.
\end{proof}
