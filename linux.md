https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)#History_of_kernel_development

- Strictly speaking, an operating system (and thus, a kernel) is not required to
run a computer. Programs can be directly loaded and executed on the "bare metal"
machine, provided that the authors of those programs are willing to work without
any hardware abstraction or operating system support.
- What's a monolithic kernel?
- In the Unix model, the operating system consists of two parts: first, the huge
collection of utility programs that drive most operations; second, the kernel
that runs the programs.
- Modern Unix-derivatives are generally based on module-loading monolithic
kernels. Examples of this are the Linux kernel in the many distributions of
GNU, IBM AIX, as well as the Berkeley Software Distribution variant kernels
such as FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and macOS.
